`libkv` provides a `Go` native library to store metadata using Distributed Key/Value stores (or common databases).

The goal of `libkv` is to abstract common store operations (Get/Put/List/etc.) for multiple distributed and/or local Key/Value store backends thus using the same self-contained codebase to manage them all.

This repository is a fork of the [docker/libkv](https://github.com/docker/libkv) project which includes many fixes/additional features and is maintained by an original project maintainer. This project is notably used by [containous/traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik), [docker/swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm) and [docker/libnetwork](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork).

As of now, `libkv` offers support for `Consul`, `Etcd`, `Zookeeper`, `Redis` (**Distributed** store) and `BoltDB` (**Local** store).

## Usage

`libkv` is meant to be used as an abstraction layer over existing distributed Key/Value stores. It is especially useful if you plan to support `consul`, `etcd` and `zookeeper` using the same codebase.

It is ideal if you plan for something written in Go that should support:

- A simple metadata storage, distributed or local
- A lightweight discovery service for your nodes
- A distributed lock mechanism

You can also easily implement a generic *Leader Election* algorithm on top of it (see the [docker/leadership](https://github.com/docker/leadership) repository).

You can find examples of usage for `libkv` under in [docs/examples.go](https://github.com/abronan/libkv/blob/master/docs/examples.md). Optionally you can also take a look at the `docker/swarm`, `docker/libnetwork` or `containous/traefik` repositories which are using `libkv` for all the use cases listed above.

## Supported versions

`libkv` supports:
- **Consul** versions >= `0.5.1` because it uses Sessions with `Delete` behavior for the use of `TTLs` (mimics zookeeper's Ephemeral node support), If you don't plan to use `TTLs`: you can use Consul version `0.4.0+`.
- **Etcd** versions >= `2.0` with **APIv2** (*deprecated*) and **APIv3** (*recommended*).
- **Zookeeper** versions >= `3.4.5`. Although this might work with previous version but this remains untested as of now.
- **Boltdb**, which shouldn't be subject to any version dependencies.
- **Redis** versions >= `3.2.6`. Although this might work with previous version but this remains untested as of now.

## Interface

A **storage backend** in `libkv` should implement (fully or partially) these interfaces:

```go
type Store interface {
	Put(key string, value []byte, options *WriteOptions) error
	Get(key string, options *ReadOptions) (*KVPair, error)
	Delete(key string) error
	Exists(key string, options *ReadOptions) (bool, error)
	Watch(key string, stopCh <-chan struct{}, options *ReadOptions) (<-chan *KVPair, error)
	WatchTree(directory string, stopCh <-chan struct{}, options *ReadOptions) (<-chan []*KVPair, error)
	NewLock(key string, options *LockOptions) (Locker, error)
	List(directory string, options *ReadOptions) ([]*KVPair, error)
	DeleteTree(directory string) error
	AtomicPut(key string, value []byte, previous *KVPair, options *WriteOptions) (bool, *KVPair, error)
	AtomicDelete(key string, previous *KVPair) (bool, error)
	Close()
}

type Locker interface {
	Lock(stopChan chan struct{}) (<-chan struct{}, error)
	Unlock() error
}
```

## Compatibility matrix

Backend drivers in `libkv` are generally divided between **local drivers** and **distributed drivers**. Distributed backends offer enhanced capabilities like `Watches` and/or distributed `Locks`.

Local drivers are usually used in complement to the distributed drivers to store informations that only needs to be available locally.

## Limitations

Distributed Key/Value stores often have different concepts for managing and formatting keys and their associated values. Even though `libkv` tries to abstract those stores aiming for some consistency, in some cases it can't be applied easily.

Please refer to the `docs/compatibility.md` to see what are the special cases for cross-backend compatibility.

Other than those special cases, you should expect the same experience for basic operations like `Get`/`Put`, etc.

Calls like `WatchTree` may return different events (or number of events) depending on the backend (for now, `Etcd` and `Consul` will likely return more events than `Zookeeper` that you should triage properly). Although you should be able to use it successfully to watch on events in an interchangeable way (see the **docker/leadership** repository or the **pkg/discovery/kv** package in **docker/docker**).

For `Redis` backend, it relies on [key space notification](https://redis.io/topics/notifications) to perform WatchXXX/Lock related features. Please read the doc before using this feature.

## TLS

Only `Consul` and `etcd` have support for TLS and you should build and provide your own `config.TLS` object to feed the client. Support is planned for `zookeeper` and `redis`.
